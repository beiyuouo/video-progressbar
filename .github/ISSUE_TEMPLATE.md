If all else fails:

## Bug Reports

If you're reporting a bug please:

* Tell us your model of Raspberry Pi
* Tell us which OS you're using: `lsb_release -d`
* Tell us which Kernel you're running: `uname -a`
* List the steps you've taken so far,
* and any solutions you've tried
* And a paste/picture of the complete output from the failing script/library might help, too!

We have a diagnostic script: `curl get.pimoroni.com/diagnostic | bash` to help you gather information.

Ready? Please delete this text and let us know what's troubling you!

## Feature Requests

If you've got some programming know-how, why not have a go at implementing a feature yourself and submit it as a pull-request?

We're always happy to talk you through refining your code to make it suitable for inclusion.
